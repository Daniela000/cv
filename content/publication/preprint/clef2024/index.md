abstract: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease causing progressive loss of cognitive and motor functions. Due to limited understanding of its mechanisms, there is no cure. Prognosis is still crucial for the effective planning of symptom treatment, however, the heterogeneity in patient progression drives the need for precision medicine research. iDPP CLEF 2024 aims to develop novel methodologies for predicting ALS disease progression, enabling the community to combine efforts and improve current prognostic methods. This report discusses our participation in tasks 1 and 2, evaluating the impact of sensor data on improving the prediction of ALSFRS-R scores. The proposed methodology combines temporal summarization techniques (extracting relevant statistics from the sensors), feature selection and extraction methods, and state-of-the-art classifiers for each ALSFRS-R question independently. Results show that random forest models yield the best overall performance, and selecting the k-best features and biclustering were the best overall feature selection and extraction strategies for tasks 1 and 2, respectively.
