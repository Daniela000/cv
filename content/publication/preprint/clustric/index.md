publication_short: "The authors proposed ClusTric, a temporal stratification approach to find disease progression groups. Applied to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, the method identifies four progression groups with distinguished characteristics."

abstract: Identifying groups of patients with similar disease progression patterns is key to understand disease heterogeneity, guide clinical decisions and improve patient care. In this paper, we propose a data-driven temporal stratification approach, ClusTric, combining triclustering and hierarchical clustering. The proposed approach enables the discovery of complex disease progression patterns not found by univariate temporal analyses. As a case study, we use Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease with a non-linear and heterogeneous disease progression. In this context, we applied ClusTric to stratify a hospital-based population (Lisbon ALS Clinic dataset) and validate it in a clinical trial population. The results unravelled four clinically relevant disease progression groups - slow progressors, moderate bulbar and spinal progressors, and fast progressors. We compared ClusTric with a state-of-the-art method, showing its effectiveness in capturing the heterogeneity of ALS disease progression in a lower number of clinically relevant progression groups
