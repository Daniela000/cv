#publication_short: "The authors proposed ClusTric, a temporal stratification approach to find disease progression groups. Applied to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, the method identifies four progression groups with distinguished characteristics."

abstract: Text simplification aims to reduce the complexity of sentences such that they are more readable and understandable. In order to simplify English text, we study different approaches, in particular, we introduce Make it Simple, a model that results from fine-tuning the BART language model and combining it with a controllable mechanism that adjusts sentence-related attributes. Furthermore, we also experimented with direct replacement of complex words to aid the simplification procedure. Finally, our model got close to the current state-of-the-art, with perhaps potential to surpass it, if the future work directions we point out, are to be followed.
